# 🚀 DS-AutoAdvisor: Data Science Diagnostic & Correction Advisor Agent

**DS-AutoAdvisor** is an agent-based automation toolkit built specifically for freelance data scientists, streamlining repetitive tasks through intelligent data profiling, automatic issue correction recommendations, integrated ML pipelines, and simplified software development workflows.

## 📌 Project Goals

- Automate repetitive data profiling and preprocessing tasks
- Recommend intelligent corrections for common data quality issues
- Automatically select and recommend ML algorithms based on data characteristics and business objectives
- Create robust, scalable ML pipelines from data ingestion to model monitoring
- Integrate software development best practices seamlessly into ML workflows
