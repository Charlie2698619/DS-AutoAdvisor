# 🏋️ Model Training Module

**Purpose:** Trains machine learning models with optimized hyperparameters.

## Files:
- `trainer.py` - Main model training functionality

## What it does:
- ✅ Multiple algorithm training (Random Forest, XGBoost, SVM, etc.)
- ✅ Automated hyperparameter optimization
- ✅ Cross-validation for model selection
- ✅ Feature importance analysis
- ✅ Model persistence and versioning
- ✅ Training metrics tracking

## Used by:
- Step 2: Pipeline testing (`2_test_pipeline.py`)
- Step 3: Production pipeline (`3_run_pipeline.py`)
