## What it does:
- âœ… Analyzes data characteristics for model selection
- âœ… Recommends best algorithms based on data type and size
- âœ… Checks statistical assumptions (normality, linearity, etc.)
- âœ… Suggests hyperparameter starting points
- âœ… Feature selection recommendations
- âœ… Cross-validation strategy suggestions

## Used by:
- Step 2: Pipeline testing (`2_test_pipeline.py`)
